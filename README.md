# Viem.ts-Documentation

This is a VS Code version of the Viem.ts JS framework documentation.

The original version can be found here: https://viem.sh/docs/getting-started

Mainly, everything you may need when mastering Viem.ts is learning clients and their methods. So head straight to the 'clients' folder and there you will see Public, Wallet and Test clients.

If you encounter any mistakes, bugs or problems feel free to contribute or contact me directly.
